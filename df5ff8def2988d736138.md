## Intro to Mind Mapping

In Mind Node
- A mind map has two trees (Left Tree & Right Tree)
- Each node (text box) inside a tree has its children

You can style the nodes individually or change global styles to make changes to your mindmap

## How to Create a Mind Map
You must click on the big + button located in the bottom right corner screen and a mind map will be created and opened for you in the editor

## How to add nodes to a mind map

If you make a mistake during this , Please press undo , located in the top bar , near the brush icon

After you have created your first mind map , You'll be presented with the empty map , Now to title your mind map click the pencil button in the bottom center of your screen , Start typing the topic name, when you are done , press the check button on your keyboard located underneath the backspace

This is your central node , It has two trees , We'll start with creating the left tree

When you pressed check button , hopefully the keyboard went away , Now press the left handle button , Its located to the left of pencil button When you click on it , Keyboard appears , Again type something and press check on keyboard and you've added a node to the left.

Now you will notice that the left handle button has changed , it has become left sub handle button and clicking on it will create a node underneath the current selected node , try it.

Now we will create our right tree with this logic in mind

You must click on the central node , the buttons below will adapt to it , press the right handle button , type something , press check on keyboard , Now handle right and sub handle right buttons appear

We've learned that there are two buttons of two types

1 - Left Handle (Create new node to left), Right Handle (Create new node to right)
2 - Left Sub Handle (Create node below current), Right Sub Handle (Create node below current)

## How to style nodes of a mind map

To style the nodes of a mind map , Click on the big brush icon in the bottom , A menu will pop up with a lot of styles , You can use it to style a single selected node , Yup , You must select the node first by tapping on the node. The opened popup includes most styles and should be very easy to understand , the upper colors list changes the text color and bottom one changes the background of the node

But We recommend that you generally try to avoid styling node individually as it would override the global styles for that node , Let's say in the future you want all the nodes to be bold / italic and you do that by changing global styles , The nodes updated individually won't follow this behavior because they override the global styles.

Individual styles are best for a special node , like a central node , style it the way you want...

## How to change global styles of a mind map

Open the options menu and click on settings in the editor to open the settings dialog , These are the global styles of a mind map , Everything you do here affects all the nodes.

The "Node Defaults" section includes styling the node and its text , similar to individual node styles , You can change these options for every node in the mind map , as discussed in "How to style nodes of a mind map"

There's "Random Background Colors" Options , Enable this and you won't have to color your nodes , because it will pick the colors automatically.

*Quick Hack* : If you wanna change the look and style of the mind map , Change connection type to "Straight And Under" and change background color to transparent in the colors list below the corner radius (transparent is the first color)

Things you should try for yourself

1 - Navigation Like (Enable this option to change controls to become navigation like)
2 - Changing spacing between the nodes (Horizontal, Vertical & Padding) , The default spacing is pretty good
3 - Changing to dark / light theme , Don't worry about the colors , Every color will find its counter part for that theme

## MindNode Modes

In MindNode There are three modes of mindmapping

1 - Layout Mapper (Easy selection & Text Box inside the mind map , interactive)
2 - Canvas Mapper (Exported Version will look the same , Very performant)
3 - Paint Mode (This just allows you to draw inside the mindmap)

You can switch between these modes by going into options menu which are located in the top right corner of the editor

## How to draw inside a mind map

To draw inside a mindmap , You must go into paint mode , To do so , You must click on the paint button in top bar , You won't miss it , Its a brush icon.

In Paint mode , the buttons change , You will be familiar with them , If you've used our other app named "Sketchable" Its dedicated to sketching and drawing , We use the same tech here. For more detailed information of Drawing , Download the app
